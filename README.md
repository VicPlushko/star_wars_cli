Star Wars CLI Project

This Star Wars CLI program gives the user information about Star Wars. The user can begin by picking from 6 different categories: People, Species, Planets, Starships, Vehicles and Films. When the user selects a category they will see a list of items from that category, for example selecting People will display a list of Star Wars characters. The user can then select an option from the list to get information about their selection. 5 of the 6 categories have multiple pages and the user has the option to go forward a page or back a page. The user may also choose to go back to the main menu to select another category. 

Installation Instructions
